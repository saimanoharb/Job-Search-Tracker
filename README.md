Struggling with the job search and tracking applications? This might help. 💡

I built something I wish I had on Day 1 —
🎯 The Ultimate Job Search Tracker
A free, no-fluff, all-in-one Excel tool designed to bring clarity, focus, and momentum to your job search.

Over the past few weeks, I’ve connected with many talented folks in tech — applying to 100s of roles, going through multiple interviews, feeling overwhelmed, and unsure what’s working.

So I built this — for myself, and for anyone navigating the search right now.

💼 What’s inside:

 ✅ Job Application Tracker – Stay on top of every role, stage, and follow-up

 ✅ Referral & Outreach Log – Organize your networking with purpose

 ✅ Study Plan + Interview Prep Log – Focus your prep and avoid burnout

 ✅ Mental Health + Daily Routine Tracker – Stay grounded and consistent

 ✅ Weekly Progress Dashboard – Measure effort, not just outcomes

 ✅ High-Impact Tips – From structuring your week to writing standout resumes

This tracker may not be perfect — but if it helps even one person bring a little structure or clarity to their search, it’s worth sharing.

Feel free to improve it, adapt it, and share it forward.
If you know someone currently searching, feel free to pass it along.
If you’ve built something for the community, I’d love to learn from it too.
We rise by lifting others. Look around and support some one who needs it.💙
